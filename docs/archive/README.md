## Why These Were Archived

1. **Historical Context Only**: Describes work already completed or abandoned
2. **Outdated Architecture**: Documents native apps that were replaced with web app
3. **Completed Migrations**: Migration guides for changes already applied
4. **Debug Logs**: Troubleshooting sessions for issues already resolved
5. **Superseded Plans**: Feature plans replaced by different implementations

## How to Use This Archive

- **For Historical Reference**: Understand past decisions and implementations
