- ✅ Basic unit tests for model validation

## Deliverables

### 1. Core Data Model Definition
**File**: `apple/WealthWise/WealthWise/CoreData/WealthWiseDataModel.xcdatamodeld/`

Created a complete Core Data model with the following entities:

#### Portfolio Entity
- Primary entity for organizing assets
- Attributes: id, name, description, currency, totalValue, isDefault, timestamps
- Relationships: One-to-many with Assets and Transactions
- Cascade deletion rules for data integrity

#### Asset Entity (Abstract Base)
- Abstract base entity providing common functionality
- 15 core attributes including encryption fields
- Supports: value tracking, purchase history, quantity management
- Relationships with Portfolio and Transactions

#### Commodity Entity (extends Asset)
- For precious metals and physical commodities
- Additional attributes: commodityType, weight, unit, purity, storageLocation
- Supports: Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium, Copper, Oil
- Computed: valuePerUnit

#### RealEstate Entity (extends Asset)
- For residential, commercial, and other properties
- Additional attributes: propertyType, address, location fields, area, mortgage
- Supports: rental income tracking, property registration
- Computed: rentalYield, netEquity

#### Bond Entity (extends Asset)
- For government and corporate bonds
- Additional attributes: bondType, issuer, ISIN, faceValue, couponRate, maturity
- Supports: credit ratings, yield calculations
- Computed: annualInterest, currentYield, hasMatured

#### ChitFund Entity (extends Asset)
- For traditional Indian savings schemes
- Additional attributes: chitValue, monthlyContribution, members, months
- Supports: prize tracking, foreman details, registration
- Computed: totalPaid, remainingMonths, isComplete

#### FixedDeposit Entity (extends Asset)
- For bank fixed and recurring deposits
- Additional attributes: bankName, depositType, interestRate, tenure, maturity
- Supports: auto-renewal, nominee details, interest calculation
- Computed: expectedReturn, hasMatured, daysUntilMaturity

#### CashHolding Entity (extends Asset)
- For bank accounts and cash
- Additional attributes: accountType, bankName, accountNumber, IFSC, UPI

- Computed: isBelowMinimum, excessBalance

#### Transaction Entity
- Records all financial transactions
- Attributes: transactionType, amount, price, quantity, dates
- Supports: encrypted references and notes
- Relationships with both Asset and Portfolio

### 2. Swift Model Extensions
**File**: `apple/WealthWise/WealthWise/CoreData/CoreDataModels.swift` (640 lines)

Implemented comprehensive Swift extensions providing:

#### Factory Methods
- Type-safe entity creation methods for each entity type
- Sensible defaults and automatic initialization
- Example: `CommodityEntity.create(in:name:commodityType:quantity:unit:currentValue:)`

#### Type-Safe Enumerations
```swift
enum CommodityType: gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper, oil, other
enum PropertyType: residential, commercial, agricultural, industrial, plot
enum BondType: government, corporate, municipal, convertible, zeroCoupon
enum DepositType: fixedDeposit, recurringDeposit, taxSaverFD, seniorCitizenFD
enum AccountType: savings, current, salary, cashInHand, moneyMarket
enum TransactionType: buy, sell, deposit, withdrawal, dividend, interest, fee, transfer
```

#### Computed Properties
- Financial calculations: gains, losses, yields, returns
- Status checks: hasMatured, isComplete, isBelowMinimum
- Helper calculations: valuePerUnit, netEquity, annualInterest

#### Localization
- All display names use `NSLocalizedString` for proper i18n
- Supports English, Hindi, and Tamil (as per project requirements)

### 3. Unit Tests
**File**: `apple/WealthWise/WealthWiseTests/CoreDataEntitiesTests.swift` (800+ lines)

Comprehensive test suite with 35+ test methods:

#### Entity Creation Tests
- Test creation of each entity type with proper initialization
- Validation of default values and required attributes
- Verification of entity type and category assignments

#### Persistence Tests
- Core Data save and fetch operations
- Context management and error handling
- Multiple entity persistence

#### Computed Property Tests
- Financial calculation accuracy (yields, returns, gains)
- Status determination (maturity, completion)
- Edge case handling (zero values, nil checks)

#### Relationship Tests
- Portfolio-to-Asset relationships
- Asset-to-Transaction relationships
- Bidirectional relationship integrity

#### Cascade Deletion Tests
- Portfolio deletion cascades to assets
- Asset deletion cascades to transactions
- Proper cleanup verification

#### Performance Tests
- Bulk asset creation (100+ entities)
- Portfolio value calculation performance
- Measured baseline for optimization
