# Feature #2 Implementation Complete - Testing Guide

## Quick Summary
✅ **Feature #2: Initial Balance as Transaction** - IMPLEMENTED

All code changes complete and error-free. Ready for testing!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (v3)
- Added `is_initial_balance BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` to transactions table
- Updated `DATABASE_VERSION` from 2 to 3

### 2. Migration System (v2→v3)
- Automatic migration adds `is_initial_balance` column
- Converts existing account balances to transactions
- Creates transaction for each account with non-zero balance
- Sets proper transaction type (income/expense), category, and date

### 3. Account Creation Flow
- When creating account with initial balance, creates transaction automatically
- Transaction marked with `is_initial_balance: true`
- Uses account creation date as transaction date

### 4. Transaction Repository
- Updated to accept and store `is_initial_balance` field
- Defaults to `false` for regular transactions

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Fresh Database (New User)
```
1. Clear browser storage/database (or use incognito mode)
2. Open application
3. Create new account "Savings" with balance ₹10,000
4. Open browser DevTools → Console
5. Expected logs:
   [DB] Initializing database...
   [DB] Database version updated to 3
   [Store] ✅ createAccount success
6. Check transactions list → Should show 1 transaction
   - Type: Income
   - Category: Initial Balance
   - Amount: ₹10,000
   - Description: Opening balance for Savings
```

### Test 2: Existing Database (Migration)
```
1. Use existing database with accounts (v2)
2. Refresh application
3. Check console for migration logs:
   [DB] Migration 2→3: Converting initial balances to transactions
   [DB] Found X accounts with initial balances
   [DB] ✅ Created initial balance transactions
   [DB] ✅ Migration 2→3 completed
4. Go to Transactions page
5. Should see initial balance transactions for existing accounts
```

### Test 3: Account with Zero Balance
```
1. Create account "Credit Card" with balance ₹0
2. Check transactions list
3. Expected: NO initial balance transaction created
```

### Test 4: Account with Negative Balance
```
1. Create account "Loan" with balance -₹50,000
2. Check transactions list
3. Expected: Transaction created with:
   - Type: Expense
   - Category: Initial Balance
   - Amount: ₹50,000 (absolute value)
```

### Test 5: Balance Calculation Accuracy
```
1. Create account "Checking" with balance ₹5,000
2. Add regular transaction: +₹2,000 (salary)
3. Check account balance
4. Expected: ₹7,000 (initial + transaction)
5. Add transaction: -₹1,000 (groceries)
6. Expected: ₹6,000
```

## Verification Checklist

### Database Structure
- [ ] `transactions` table has `is_initial_balance` column
- [ ] Column type is BOOLEAN
- [ ] Column has DEFAULT false constraint
- [ ] Existing transactions have `is_initial_balance = false`

### Migration
- [ ] Migration runs without errors
- [ ] Initial transactions created for existing accounts
- [ ] Transaction dates match account creation dates
- [ ] Transaction categories are "Initial Balance"
- [ ] Positive balances → income transactions
- [ ] Negative balances → expense transactions

### Account Creation
- [ ] Accounts with positive balance get income transaction
- [ ] Accounts with negative balance get expense transaction
- [ ] Accounts with zero balance get NO transaction
- [ ] Transaction descriptions include account name
- [ ] Transactions marked as `is_initial_balance: true`

### Balance Calculations
- [ ] Total balance includes initial balance transactions
- [ ] Balance calculations are accurate
- [ ] Transaction cache still works (check performance)

### UI Display
- [ ] Initial balance transactions appear in transaction list
- [ ] Transactions sorted correctly by date
- [ ] Account balances display correctly
- [ ] No UI errors or warnings

## Performance Verification

### Migration Performance
```
Check console for migration time:
[DB] Migration 2→3: Converting initial balances to transactions
[DB] Found X accounts with initial balances
[DB] ✅ Created initial balance transactions
[DB] ✅ Migration 2→3 completed

Expected: < 1 second for typical database (< 100 accounts)
```

### Account Creation Performance
```
Monitor console for account creation:
[Store] createAccount called
[Store] ✅ createAccount success

Expected: < 100ms additional time for transaction creation
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Migration Doesn't Run
**Symptom**: No migration logs in console
**Solution**: Check `settings` table, ensure `db_version = 2`
**Fix**: Manually update: `UPDATE settings SET value = '2' WHERE key = 'db_version'`

### Issue 2: Duplicate Initial Transactions
**Symptom**: Multiple initial balance transactions for same account
**Solution**: Migration ran multiple times
**Fix**: Delete duplicates: `DELETE FROM transactions WHERE is_initial_balance = true AND id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(id) FROM transactions WHERE is_initial_balance = true GROUP BY account_id)`

### Issue 3: Balance Mismatch
**Symptom**: Account balance ≠ transaction sum
**Solution**: Check if both account.balance and initial transaction exist
**Fix**: Expected behavior (dual storage for backward compatibility)

## Debug Commands

### Check Database Version
```sql
SELECT value FROM settings WHERE key = 'db_version';
-- Expected: '3'
```

### List Initial Balance Transactions
```sql
SELECT t.*, a.name as account_name 
FROM transactions t 
JOIN accounts a ON t.account_id = a.id 
WHERE t.is_initial_balance = true 
ORDER BY t.date;
```

### Compare Account Balance with Transaction Sum
```sql
SELECT 
  a.id,
  a.name,
  a.balance as account_balance,
  COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN t.type = 'income' THEN t.amount ELSE -t.amount END), 0) as transaction_sum
FROM accounts a
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON a.id = t.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name, a.balance;
```

### Count Initial Transactions
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions WHERE is_initial_balance = true;
```

## Success Criteria

✅ All tests pass
✅ No console errors
✅ Balances accurate
✅ Migration completes successfully
✅ Performance acceptable (< 1s migration, < 100ms account creation)
✅ UI displays correctly

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **If All Tests Pass**:
   - Mark Feature #2 as complete ✅
   - Move to Feature #3 (Deposit extensions)
   - Consider adding UI indicator for initial balance transactions

2. **If Issues Found**:
   - Document issue in console/logs
   - Review migration logic
   - Check transaction creation flow
   - Verify type definitions match schema

3. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add visual indicator in UI for initial balance transactions
   - Add filter to show/hide initial balances
   - Add validation to ensure balance matches transaction sum
