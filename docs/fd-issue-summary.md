# FD Issue - Summary & Next Steps

## Current Status: DEBUGGING MODE ENABLED

### What We've Fixed
1. ✅ Added all deposit types to FILTER_OPTIONS (lines 37-63 in AccountsList.tsx)
2. ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to account creation
3. ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to account filtering

### What You Need to Do

**CRITICAL: Hard Refresh Your Browser**
```
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

The changes I made won't appear without a hard refresh because of browser caching.

### Then Follow These Steps:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)

2. **Try Creating an FD Account**:
   - Click "Add Account"
   - Select "Fixed Deposit" from type dropdown
   - Enter: Name="Test FD", Balance=₹10,000
   - Click "Add Account"

3. **Check Console Output**:
   - You should see: "🔍 DEBUG: Creating Account"
   - Then: "🔍 DEBUG: Filtering Accounts"
   - Screenshot both debug sections

4. **Report Back**:
   - Is "Fixed Deposit" visible in the type dropdown?
   - What does the console show?
   - Does the FD appear in the list?

## Detailed Guide

See: `/docs/fd-debug-steps.md` for complete step-by-step instructions.

## Possible Issues

### Issue A: Hard Refresh Needed
If you don't see "Fixed Deposit" in the dropdown, you need to hard refresh to get the latest code.

### Issue B: Dev Server Not Running
Make sure the dev server is running:
```bash
cd /Users/chaitanyakkamatham/Projects/wealth-wise/webapp
npm run dev
```

### Issue C: Build Cache
If hard refresh doesn't work:
```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Clear cache and restart
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

## What the Debug Logs Will Tell Us

### Scenario 1: Account Created Successfully
```
🔍 DEBUG: Creating Account
  ✅ Account created successfully
  📊 Total accounts after creation: 5
  🔎 All account types: [..., {name: "Test FD", type: "fixed_deposit"}]

🔍 DEBUG: Filtering Accounts  
  Total accounts: 5
  All accounts: [..., {name: "Test FD", type: "fixed_deposit", is_active: true}]
  Final filtered accounts: [5 accounts including Test FD]
```
**Meaning**: Account is created and should be visible. If not visible, it's a rendering issue.

### Scenario 2: Account Created But Filtered Out
```
🔍 DEBUG: Creating Account
  ✅ Account created successfully

🔍 DEBUG: Filtering Accounts
  All accounts: [..., {name: "Test FD", type: "fixed_deposit", is_active: true}]
  Current filter: {type: "bank"}  ← LOOK HERE
  Final filtered accounts: [only bank accounts]
```
**Meaning**: A filter is active. Clear the filter or select "All" from dropdown.

### Scenario 3: Account Not Created
```
🔍 DEBUG: Creating Account
  ❌ Error creating account: [error message]
```
**Meaning**: Database or validation error. Check the specific error message.

### Scenario 4: Account Created as Inactive
```
🔍 DEBUG: Filtering Accounts
  All accounts: [..., {name: "Test FD", type: "fixed_deposit", is_active: false}]  ← LOOK HERE
  Final filtered accounts: [doesn't include Test FD]
```
**Meaning**: Account is being created with is_active=false. We need to fix the creation logic.

## Once You Provide Console Output

Based on what the logs show, I'll know exactly where the problem is:
- Database creation issue → Check schema
- Filtering issue → Fix filter logic  
- Rendering issue → Check AccountCard component
- Store issue → Check account store synchronization

## Files with Debug Logging

1. `/webapp/src/features/accounts/components/AccountsList.tsx`
   - Lines 82-108: Filter debug logging
   - Lines 128-147: Account creation debug logging

2. `/webapp/src/features/dashboard/components/NetWorthHero.tsx`
   - Lines 25-38: Net worth calculation debug logging

All console logs are prefixed with 🔍 emoji for easy identification.
