# Feature Implementation Checklist

This checklist provides a comprehensive guide for implementing new features in the WealthWise application, following our new client-server architecture.

---

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup

- [ ] **1.1. Requirement Analysis**: Fully understand the feature specifications, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
- [ ] **1.2. Architectural Review**: Discuss with the team how the new feature fits into the existing backend and frontend architecture.
- [ ] **1.3. Task Breakdown**: Decompose the feature into smaller, manageable tasks (e.g., create new DB model, build API endpoint, create UI component).
- [ ] **1.4. Create Tracking Issue**: Create a main issue on GitHub to track the overall feature progress. Create sub-tasks for each part of the implementation.
- [ ] **1.5. Create Git Branch**: Create a new feature branch from the `main` branch (e.g., `feature/issue-123-new-feature-name`).

---

### Phase 2: Backend Development (API-First Approach)

- [ ] **2.1. Database Schema/Model**:
    - [ ] Define or update the necessary database schemas/models.
    - [ ] Create or update corresponding TypeScript types/interfaces in a shared location.
    - [ ] Generate and run database migrations if applicable.
- [ ] **2.2. Service Layer**:
    - [ ] Create a new service file (e.g., `services/api/src/services/featureService.ts`).
    - [ ] Implement the core business logic for the feature within this service.
    - [ ] Ensure all data access and complex calculations happen here, not in controllers.
- [ ] **2.3. Controller Layer**:
    - [ ] Create a new controller file (e.g., `services/api/src/controllers/featureController.ts`).
    - [ ] Create controller functions to handle incoming requests.
    - [ ] Keep controllers thin: they should only parse requests, call the service layer, and format responses.
- [ ] **2.4. Routing**:
    - [ ] Create a new routes file (e.g., `services/api/src/routes/featureRoutes.ts`).
    - [ ] Define the API endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/features`, `POST /api/features`).
    - [ ] Apply necessary middleware (authentication, pagination, validation).
    - [ ] Wire up the new routes in the main router (`routes/index.ts`).
- [ ] **2.5. API Documentation & Testing**:
    - [ ] Document the new endpoints in the API `README.md` or using a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI.
    - [ ] Perform initial testing of the endpoints using an API client (e.g., Postman, Insomnia, or a simple cURL command).

---

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Thin Client)

- [ ] **3.1. State Management (Zustand)**:
    - [ ] Define the state shape for the new feature in a new store (e.g., `webapp/src/stores/featureStore.ts`).
    - [ ] Create actions that call the new backend API endpoints.
    - [ ] Handle loading, success, and error states.
- [ ] **3.2. API Service Layer (Frontend)**:
    - [ ] Create a frontend service or functions to abstract API calls (e.g., `webapp/src/core/api/featureApi.ts`). This keeps API logic out of components and stores.
- [ ] **3.3. Component Development**:
    - [ ] Create new React components in the `webapp/src/features/` directory.
    - [ ] Components should be "dumb" where possible, receiving data and callbacks as props.
    - [ ] Use existing Radix UI components for UI primitives whenever possible.
    - [ ] Ensure components are responsive and accessible.
- [ ] **3.4. Integration & UI/UX**:
    - [ ] Connect components to the Zustand store to display data and dispatch actions.
    - [ ] Implement loading indicators, error messages, and success notifications.
    - [ ] Add the new feature to the main application navigation/routing.
    - [ ] Polish the UI/UX, ensuring it aligns with the application's design system.

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **4.1. Backend Unit/Integration Tests**:
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the service layer's business logic.
    - [ ] Write integration tests for the API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.
- [ ] **4.2. Frontend Unit/Component Tests**:
    - [ ] Write unit tests for Zustand store logic.
    - [ ] Write component tests using React Testing Library to verify rendering and user interactions.
- [ ] **4.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing**:
    - [ ] Create E2E tests (e.g., using Playwright or Cypress) for the critical user flows of the new feature.
- [ ] **4.4. Manual QA**:
    - [ ] Perform thorough manual testing in a staging environment.
    - [ ] Test on different browsers and devices.
    - [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment

- [ ] **5.1. Code Documentation**:
    - [ ] Ensure all new functions, classes, and complex logic are documented with TSDoc/JSDoc comments.
- [ ] **5.2. Update Project Documentation**:
    - [ ] Update any relevant documents in the `/docs` folder.
    - [ ] If the feature introduces new environment variables, document them.
- [ ] **5.3. Pull Request (PR)**:
    - [ ] Create a PR and link it to the tracking issue.
    - [ ] Write a clear PR description explaining the "what" and "why" of the changes.
    - [ ] Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.
    - [ ] Request reviews from relevant team members.
- [ ] **5.4. Code Review & Merge**:
    - [ ] Address all feedback from the code review.
    - [ ] Once approved and all checks pass, squash and merge the PR into the `main` branch.
- [ ] **5.5. Deployment**:
    - [ ] Deploy the changes to the staging/production environment.
    - [ ] Monitor the application for any issues after deployment.
- [ ] **5.6. Cleanup**:
    - [ ] Close the GitHub issue.
    - [ ] Delete the feature branch.
