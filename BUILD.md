# - Homebrew (if not present)
# - Node.js, TypeScript, Firebase CLI
# - Xcode Command Line Tools, CocoaPods
# - Java 17, Android SDK/Studio
# - .NET SDK
# - VS Code extensions
```

### 2. Build All Platforms
```bash
# Development builds
./scripts/build.sh debug all

# Release builds  
./scripts/build.sh release all

# Specific platform
./scripts/build.sh debug ios
./scripts/build.sh debug android
./scripts/build.sh debug windows
```

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
# All tests across platforms
./scripts/test.sh

# Platform-specific tests
cd ios && xcodebuild test -workspace UnifiedBanking.xcworkspace -scheme UnifiedBankingTests
cd android && ./gradlew test
cd windows && dotnet test
```

### 4. Development Workflow
```bash
# Start individual platform development
./scripts/dev-ios.sh      # iOS Simulator
./scripts/dev-android.sh  # Android Emulator  
./scripts/dev-windows.sh  # Windows Debug Build

# Shared library development
cd shared && npm run build:watch
```

## 🔧 Platform-Specific Development

### iOS Development
```bash
cd ios
pod install
open WealthWise.xcworkspace

# Key frameworks used:
# - SwiftUI for UI
# - Core Data for persistence  
# - Core ML for smart categorization (optional, device-dependent)
# - Keychain Services for security
```

### Android Development
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Key libraries used:
# - Jetpack Compose for UI
# - Room with SQLCipher for database
# - ML Kit for smart features (optional, device-dependent)
# - Android Keystore for security
```

### Windows Development
```bash
cd windows
dotnet restore
dotnet build

# Key technologies:
# - WPF/WinUI 3 for UI
# - Entity Framework Core for data
# - ML.NET for intelligent features (optional, device-dependent)
# - Windows Hello for authentication
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing (CI/CD)
- **Unit Tests**: Platform-specific and shared library tests
- **Integration Tests**: Firebase backend integration
- **E2E Tests**: Full user journey testing with Detox
- **Performance Tests**: Memory and speed benchmarks
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning and compliance
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader and navigation testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Account linking (bank, credit card, UPI)
- [ ] Transaction import and categorization
- [ ] Budget creation and tracking
- [ ] Multi-device sync
- [ ] Offline functionality
- [ ] Biometric authentication
- [ ] Data export/import

## 🚀 Deployment

### Staging Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
./scripts/deploy.sh staging all

# Individual platforms
./scripts/deploy.sh staging ios      # TestFlight
./scripts/deploy.sh staging android  # Play Internal Testing
./scripts/deploy.sh staging windows  # Local package
```

### Production Deployment  
```bash
# Full production deployment

# This deploys:
# - iOS to App Store Connect
# - Android to Google Play Store
# - Windows installer packages
# - Firebase backend updates
```
