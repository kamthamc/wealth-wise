# Universal Debug Mode Instructions

You are in debug mode for cross-platform applications. Your primary objective is to systematically identify, analyze, and resolve bugs across all supported platforms while maintaining security standards and platform-specific optimizations.

## Phase 1: Problem Assessment

1. **Gather Context**: Understand the current issue by:
   - Reading compilation errors, runtime crashes, or failure reports
   - Examining the project structure and recent changes
   - Identifying expected vs actual behavior
   - Reviewing relevant unit tests and their failures
   - Checking GitHub issues for related bug reports using `mcp_github_list_issues`

2. **Reproduce the Bug**: Before making any changes:
   - Build the application using platform-appropriate tools
   - Run unit tests to confirm the issue
   - Document exact steps to reproduce the problem
   - Capture error outputs, crash logs, or unexpected behaviors
   - Provide a clear bug report with:
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Expected behavior
     - Actual behavior
     - Platform-specific error messages/stack traces
     - Platform version and environment details

## Phase 2: Investigation

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Trace code execution path leading to the bug
   - Examine platform-specific concurrency and threading issues
   - Check for common platform issues (null references, memory leaks, race conditions)
   - Use `semantic_search` and `list_code_usages` to understand component interactions
   - Review git history using `mcp_github_list_commits` for recent changes
   - Analyze security implications if bug affects sensitive data

4. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - Form specific hypotheses about platform-specific issues
   - Prioritize based on security impact and likelihood
   - Plan verification steps for each hypothesis
   - Consider platform-specific differences and constraints

## Phase 3: Resolution

5. **Implement Fix**:
   - Make targeted changes following platform-specific patterns
   - Ensure proper async/threading patterns for the platform
   - Maintain encryption for sensitive data using platform APIs
   - Follow established UI patterns and accessibility guidelines
   - Add defensive programming practices
   - Consider edge cases and platform-specific behaviors

6. **Verification**:
   - Run unit tests to verify fix resolves the issue
   - Execute original reproduction steps
   - Test on target platform versions
   - Verify security measures remain intact
   - Test accessibility and localization features

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance

7. **Code Quality**:
   - Review fix for Swift 6 compliance and modern patterns
   - Add or update unit tests to prevent regression
   - Update documentation and code comments
   - Ensure platform-specific code uses proper availability checks
   - Verify glass effects work on iOS 26+/macOS 26+ only

8. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Link fix to related GitHub issue using `mcp_github_add_issue_comment`
   - Update issue status using `mcp_github_update_issue`
   - Create pull request if fix is substantial
   - Document security implications in issue comments

9. **Final Report**:
   - Summarize what was fixed and how
   - Explain root cause in Swift/SwiftUI context
   - Document security measures maintained
   - Suggest improvements to prevent similar issues
   - Note any platform-specific considerations

## WealthWise-Specific Debugging Guidelines

### Security Focus
- Always verify financial data encryption remains intact
- Test biometric authentication flows after changes
- Ensure Keychain integration continues working
- Validate input sanitization for financial data

### Swift 6 Patterns
- Check actor isolation compliance
- Verify typed throws implementation
- Ensure proper async/await usage
- Test Sendable protocol conformance

### Platform Considerations
- Test iOS-specific features (background tasks, shortcuts)
- Verify macOS-specific functionality (menu bar, window management)
- Ensure glass effects only activate on supported OS versions
- Test accessibility on both platforms

### Financial Accuracy
- Use Decimal for all currency calculations
- Test rounding behavior for Indian rupees
- Verify transaction categorization accuracy
- Check account balance calculations

## Debugging Tools Priority
1. `get_errors` - Check compilation and runtime errors first
2. `semantic_search` - Find related code patterns
3. `grep_search` - Search for specific error patterns
4. `list_code_usages` - Understand component dependencies
5. `run_in_terminal` - Execute build and test commands
6. `mcp_github_get_issue` - Get context from related issues

Remember: Always prioritize security and financial data integrity when debugging. A well-understood Swift 6 concurrency issue is half solved.
